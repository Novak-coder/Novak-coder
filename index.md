## Welcome to Novak Space

I would like to share what I gain from daily work and previous experience here, including some ideas on various OS, languages, trips and foods.
Of course I also need you tell me some stuffs about the defect or weakness of my idea so that I can know more about the truth of this world.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Novak-coder/Novak-coder/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

The world is a chessboard on which we play the game that never supposed to be 
fair. 
I hate to say this but it gets to decide what kind of role we start with
when we come to this world. 
The world is not fair, but it doesn't make any less worthy of living. 
So go play with what you have, carefully but boldly at the same time to 
unleash the unknow possibility of the life.
